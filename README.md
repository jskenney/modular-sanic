# Modular Sanic

Using Sanic (https://sanic.dev, https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic) as the core, the goal of Modular Sanic is to handle basic tasks such as authentication and connections to memcached and MySQL, while loading API endpoints by searching directories for python scripts with the appropriate modules.
